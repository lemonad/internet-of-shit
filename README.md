# internet-of-shit
Arduino project to measure, track and calculate poop volume in a tank.

It may not be the most important issue to solve but if you forget to empty you tank of poop you might end up in deep shit (literally speaking). With an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino kit I tried to solve this in techie way. An easy solution would be to lift the lid once in a while but then you can't get the data, statistics, tracking and all other things that comes with an automated solution.

This is the first version but the plan is to connect the project to a Domoticz home automation system and get notifications, graphs and other functionality.
